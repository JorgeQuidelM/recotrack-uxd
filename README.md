## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Understanding the Context

Urban waste management poses an increasing challenge for the city of Temuco, particularly due to its large population and its significant contribution to regional waste generation. One of the main issues lies in the lack of real-time information regarding garbage truck routes, leading to inefficient collection, accumulation of waste in residential and public areas, and growing dissatisfaction among citizens. This is compounded by limited public awareness around waste separation, which increases the volume of waste and contributes to environmental pollution.
