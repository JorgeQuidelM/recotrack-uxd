## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Understanding the Context

Urban waste management poses an increasing challenge for the city of Temuco, particularly due to its large population and its significant contribution to regional waste generation. One of the main issues lies in the lack of real-time information regarding garbage truck routes, leading to inefficient collection, accumulation of waste in residential and public areas, and growing dissatisfaction among citizens. This is compounded by limited public awareness around waste separation, which increases the volume of waste and contributes to environmental pollution.

## 3. Strategy

In this section, we define what the application aims to achieve and how it will deliver meaningful value to its target audience. Through the use of research-driven tools and design methodologies, we ensure that the solution is not only technically functional but also deeply aligned with the real needs, behaviors, and expectations of its users.

### 3.1. Value Proposition Canvas

To deepen our understanding of users and refine the value our solution delivers, we developed a Value Proposition Canvas. This tool helps us identify user tasks, pain points, and desired gains, and align them with specific features and benefits of the system to ensure our solution directly responds to those needs.
